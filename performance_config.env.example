# Performance Optimization Configuration
# Copy this file to performance_config.env and modify the values

# Frame Processing Optimization
# Process every Nth frame (1 = every frame, 2 = every 2nd frame, etc.)
# Higher values = faster processing but less smooth tracking
PROCESS_EVERY_N_FRAMES=1

# Use camera substream for lower resolution (faster processing)
# true = use substream (/Streaming/Channels/102), false = use main stream
USE_SUBSTREAM=true

# YOLO Model Selection (for speed vs accuracy trade-off)
# yolov5n = fastest, yolov5s = balanced, yolov5m = slower but more accurate
YOLO_MODEL=yolov5n

# Confidence Threshold (higher = faster, fewer detections)
# 0.25 = detect more objects, 0.5 = balanced, 0.75 = only high-confidence detections
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.5

# IOU Threshold for NMS (higher = more aggressive filtering)
# 0.45 = default, 0.6 = more aggressive, 0.3 = less aggressive
IOU_THRESHOLD=0.45

# Motion Detection Sensitivity
# Lower values = more sensitive, higher values = less sensitive
MOTION_THRESHOLD=25.0

# Motion Detection Minimum Area
# Lower values = detect smaller movements, higher values = ignore small movements
MIN_MOTION_AREA=500
